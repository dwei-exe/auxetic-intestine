# Patient-Specific Artificial Intestine
## Biomechanics of Auxetic Structures

*A custom algorithm that creates patient-specific artificial intestines from 3D medical scans, converting them into flat, 3D printable exoskeletons ready for easy manufacturing.*

## üìã Project Overview

Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide, affecting 1.9 million people annually. Current research focuses on nutrient absorption at the microscopic level, but lacks effective solutions for macroscopic peristalsis (the wave-like muscle contractions that move food through the digestive system).

This project addresses the **engineering problem** of simulating intestine peristalsis by developing an algorithm that converts 3D mesh data into a parametrized, foldable, and articulated exoskeleton that simulates peristalsis.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Software Features

- **User-Specified Boundary Settings**: Customizable starting vertex selection
- **Parameterization Outcomes**: Different starting points affect optimization results  
- **Customizable Dimensions**: Adjustable width and height for boundary mapping
- **3D Mesh Processing**: Handles wavefront OBJ files (3D mesh format)
